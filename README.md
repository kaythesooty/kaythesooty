# Hi there, I'm Riley!
I'm a software developer from New Zealand with a solid base knowledge of Javasript, Typescript, and React. Videogames and old hardware are my bread and butter, but I've found a love of coding no matter the task.
## About Me
I've recently finished a 9 week bootcamp from DevAcademy Aotearoa focusing on full stack web development. As well as Programming and problem solving skills, we also focused on human skills like teamwork, communication, and conflict solving.

Video game development is a great passion of mine and my final project MyCelium was an excellent finish to the course being a game where you grow mushrooms. I also enjoy repairing and modifying old hardware including video game consoles and older PCs.
## Projects
### MyCelium üçÑ
MyCelium is a game where you grow mushrooms for profit so you can grow new and better mushrooms. It was made in a week by a team of 7 for our final project at DevAcademy. It uses Typescript React for UI elements such as buttons, and uses a JavaScript framework called Phaser which is built for making games in the web browser. This was a brand new stack for us and we spend a good 2 days learning how to use the new tools before we could properly dive in to writing code.
#### Where to now?
There is much to do, stay tuned...
### Smoke ‚ô®Ô∏è
Smoke is my first proper foray into the C programming language. Smoke is a command line tool for managing and playing games. You can add or remove games, list all games, and filter games by short name. Actually playing the game is not yet implemented.
#### Where to now?
Downloading games would be an amazing goal to achieve.
### Clans üî¥
Very simple app built with React and SQLite3 (via knex) where you can view profiles of cats and their clans. Built for an assessment in bootcamp, it uses a database to store cat and clan info, and all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are possible.
#### Where to now?
Right now there are no checks on who you delete, so you can remove a leader with no deputy to take the role, or even remove all the cats in a clan. This is the next thing to be fixed.
Some styling and fancy layouts will be nice in the future.
### CatGen üêà
React app for generating random cats for use in the game ClanGen. Originally a simple Javascript and HTML app, I rewrote it in TypeScript React for bootcamp since that was the assignment. You can generate a completely random cat, or customise each individual component to perfect your little warrior.
#### Where to now?
Styling is a much needed thing. The current version is practical, but not the nicest to look at or even to use. Better layout, fancy styling, and better UX overall are big next steps. There are also additional options to add to customisation such as conditions and accessories.
