# Hi there, I'm Riley!
I'm a software developer from New Zealand with a solid base knowledge of Javasript, Typescript, and React. Videogames and old hardware are my bread and butter, but I've found a love of coding no matter the task.
## About Me
I've recently finished a 9 week bootcamp from DevAcademy Aotearoa focusing on full stack web development. As well as Programming and problem solving skills, we also focused on human skills like teamwork, communication, and conflict solving.

Video game development is a great passion of mine and my final project MyCelium was an excellent finish to the course being a game where you grow mushrooms. I also enjoy repairing and modifying old hardware including video game consoles and older PCs.
## Projects
### MyCelium üçÑ
MyCelium is a game where you grow mushrooms for profit so you can grow new and better mushrooms. It was made in a week by a team of 7 for our final project at DevAcademy. It uses Typescript React for UI elements such as buttons, and uses a JavaScript framework called Phaser which is built for making games in the web browser. This was a brand new stack for us and we spend a good 2 days learning how to use the new tools before we could properly dive in to writing code.
### Smoke ‚ô®Ô∏è
Smoke is my first proper foray into the C programming language. Smoke is a command line tool for managing and playing games. You can add or remove games, list all games, and filter games by short name. Actually playing the game is not yet implemented.
### Clans üî¥
Very simple app built with React and SQLite3 (via knex) where you can view profiles of cats and their clans. Built for an assessment in bootcamp, it uses a database to store cat and clan info, and all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are possible.
### CatGen üêà
React app for generating random cats for use in the game ClanGen. Originally a simple Javascript and HTML app, I rewrote it in TypeScript React for bootcamp since that was the assignment. You can generate a completely random cat, or customise each individual component to prefect your little warrior.
